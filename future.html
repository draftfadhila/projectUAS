			<i>"Do witches have to leave home as part of their training?"<br>"Yes, it's an old custom. If a child wants to be a witch, she leaves home when she turns 13."<br>"How soon. So Kiki is at that age already?"<br>"But to leave home alone so young, it won't do in this day and age."<br>"I remember well the day you came to this town. A tiny, 13-year-old girl riding on a broom, dropping out of the sky. Eyes sparkling, a bit saucy..."<br>"But that child, all she's mastered is flying. And there'll be no one to carry on my medicine-making."<br>"It's the fault of the times. Everything's changing."</i>

			<i>"I see...So that's why you're looking for your own town."<br>"The people of this town don't seem to like witches."<br>"It's a big town, and there are all kinds of people. But me, I like you. And have you found a place to stay? No? Well, if that's the case, why didn't you say something earlier. We have a spare room you can use."</i>
			<br>—Osono offering Kiki a place to stay

			In exchange for accommodation, Kiki helps Osono, while she helps mind the store. She confesses that her only skill happens to be flying, thus they decide to open a "Witch Delivery Business", delivering goods by broomstick. Unfortunately, her first delivery goes badly as she is caught by a strong gust of wind and loses the black cat toy she is supposed to deliver.<br>Meanwhile, Kiki finds the toy cat in the cabin of a young painter, Ursula. Noticing that the toy is ripped, Ursula offers to mend it in exchange for Kiki cleaning her floor. Once it is fixed, Ursula returns the doll and Kiki hurries off to save Jiji. They are able to make the switch easily with the help of Jeff and return home.

			<i>"Magic and painting are a lot alike. You know, a lot of times, I just can't paint."<br>"Really? When that happens, what do you do? Before, I could fly without giving it a thought. But now, I don't know how I did it."<br>"When that happens, all one can do is struggle through it. I draw and draw, and keep drawing."<br>"But then, if I can't fly..."<br>"Then I stop drawing. I take walks, look at the scenery, take naps, do nothing. Then after a while, all of a sudden I get the urge to draw again.."</i>

			<i>"Father, Mother, how are you? Jiji and I are both very well. My work's on the right track and I'm confident. It's been hard sometimes, but I love this town."</i>
			<br>—Kiki's letter to her parents

			The following morning, Kiki is visiting Barsa and Madame. At the same time, the television reports that the dirigible "The Spirit of Freedom" is set to depart. As the "Seahorse Band" and crowd bid the airship farewell, a sudden gale dislodges the airship's moors and is blown off course, with Tombo hanging from the rope under the airship. The airship manages to crash into the clock tower and is suspended above the town plaza. Kiki then witnesses the Tombo hanging from one of the drifting vessel's mooring lines.<br>As the radio reports that the helium within the dirigible is not likely to explode, Kiki takes a street sweeper's push-broom and regains her flying power and flies towards Tombo. Kiki flies as fast as she can and, after some initial struggling with keeping the broom in place, manages to rescue Tombo as he slips and falls. She regains her confidence, resumes her delivery service. The story ends when Kiki writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy and doing great with her witch skills.
